            <h2>Heyy, Cutie</h2>
            <p>
                How are you? I hope you’re doing well. Since I left, I've felt this weight — not expressing how I feel about you. It’s been on my mind, and I realized It's not fair to keep it to myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t know how you feel about me, but I can honestly say you were the only reason I looked forward to coming to work every day. I wouldn’t go to this extent to express myself if it weren’t this serious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve been holding this in for a while, but I didn’t want to leave without telling you how I feel. I think you’re amazing, and I’d like to get to know you better if you’re open to it.
            </p>

                I was actually planning to give this to you in person, but HR decided to play Cupid’s villain and ended my notice period early. Guess they didn’t want me hanging around — probably noticed the way I looked at you and thought, Not on my watch.😂
